# Dark Matter Halos Affects On The Solar System

This was one of my masters project which involved modelling how different Dark Matter Halos affected the orbit of the planets using different numerical integrators.

This work included:

- Modelling Dark Matter Halos of the the type:
  - Kepler
  - Logarithmic
  - Plummer Sphere

- Exploring Kirkwood Gaps

- Implementing and comparing several integrators:
  - Regular Euler
  - Symplectic Euler
  - LeapFrog Algorithm

- Symmetry break of Mercury's orbit

- The N-Body problem

- Precessing orbits due to isolating integrals

- Orbit velocity
